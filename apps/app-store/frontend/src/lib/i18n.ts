/**
 * The console's own words, in the viewer's language (AD-15).
 *
 * The same arrangement as the desktop's `src/lib/i18n.ts` in gentian-ui, and
 * deliberately the same rather than a second design: an operator moves between
 * the two in one session, and a platform that agreed with itself about
 * everything except how it picks a language would be the odd one out in the
 * only place a person notices.
 *
 * **Adding a language is one file.** Drop `src/locales/<code>.json` in, copy
 * the keys from `en.json`, translate them. Nothing here is edited: the
 * catalogues are discovered at build time by the glob below, and the language
 * list and the detector derive from what was found. That is the whole reason
 * the catalogues are JSON rather than TypeScript — a translator needs no
 * toolchain, and the files go to a translation service and come back without
 * anybody touching code.
 *
 * English is the fallback because it is the language the source strings are
 * written in. A key missing from a translation renders the English sentence
 * the author wrote, never a blank and never the key itself, so a language is
 * shippable while it is still half translated.
