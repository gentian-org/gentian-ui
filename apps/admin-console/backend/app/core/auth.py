"""Who the caller is.

The bearer on a request is verified here and nowhere else. Under edge it is
the zone's token, put on the request by the platform's Gateway, minted for the
director; under pkce it is the bundle's own. Both are RS256 tokens from the
configured issuer and both are verified the same way: signature against the
issuer's published keys, issuer, expiry, and the audience this component was
told to require. Nothing about the mode changes the verification, only who
put the header there.

What this does not do is decide what the caller may do. That is the director's
answer, obtained by relaying the same token (see director.py). This module
establishes who is asking; it grants nothing.
