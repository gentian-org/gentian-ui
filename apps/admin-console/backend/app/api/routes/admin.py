"""The console's own context, and an honest answer for every screen that is
not yet a client of the director.

Context
-------
Which screens exist for this person is decided from two answers of the
director: the tenant's verbs, asked on the tenant this console runs in, and
the cluster's verbs. Nothing here reads a group out of a token. The tenant is
the one the platform put this component in, which is the only tenant this
console administers; a platform administrator reaching into another tenant
does so through that tenant's own console, never through this process.

Screens not yet mapped
----------------------
The console was carved out of the desktop, where its screens reached Keycloak
and Kubernetes through the desktop's backend with credentials this component
must not hold. Each screen is being re-pointed at the director one at a time.
Until a screen's director endpoints exist, the route it calls is answered 501
with a message naming the screen, so the console shows exactly that rather
than a spinner or a fabricated empty state. The table below is the list of
what is left; a screen leaves it by getting a real route above it.
