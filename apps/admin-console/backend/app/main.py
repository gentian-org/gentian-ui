"""The administration console's own API: a relay to the director, and nothing else.

This process holds no credential and keeps no state. It verifies the token the
platform's edge forwards, relays it to the director when a screen needs an
answer, and hands the answer back unchanged. Whatever a person may see or
change here is decided by the director from the authorization graph.
