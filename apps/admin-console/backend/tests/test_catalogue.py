"""The cluster's own catalogue screen: a relay, and nothing more.

What is worth pinning here is not the plumbing but the DIVISION. Which
editions are listed, which entries may be installed and which digest is
trustworthy are all the director's answers; this component must not have an
opinion about any of them, because a second opinion is a second answer to the
